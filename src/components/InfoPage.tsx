                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The MHI score is calculated based on the median household income in Montgomery County, Maryland ($125,371 in 2023) 
                  and the service area coverage. This score reflects how well a towing company serves communities across different 
                  income levels. A higher score indicates better service coverage across diverse economic areas.

                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The distance score is calculated using the Haversine formula multiplied by 1.4 to account for actual road distances 
                  rather than straight-line distances. This adjustment factor provides a more realistic estimate of travel time and 
                  service coverage area. A higher score indicates better proximity and faster potential response times.

                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The Community Equity Index (CEI) measures how equitably a towing company serves different communities. This score 
                  takes into account factors such as service availability, response times, and pricing fairness across different 
                  neighborhoods. A higher score indicates more equitable service delivery.

                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  All scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale to ensure fair comparison between different metrics. This normalization 
                  process allows us to combine different measurements into a single, meaningful ranking system while maintaining the 
                  relative performance differences between companies.
